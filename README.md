# 🛡️ My Security

**My Security** is a web platform that helps users check the security status of their region in the Greater Tunis area using an interactive map. The application visualizes security levels by area and provides tailored safety recommendations.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The project uses **OpenStreetMap** to display markers indicating the safety level of different regions. Users can search by **postal code** or click directly on the map to view the status of their neighborhood.

Each marker on the map reflects a security level with a specific color:

- 🟢 Green – Safe  
- 🟡 Yellow – Moderate Risk  
- 🔴 Red – High Risk  

Based on the current level, the platform suggests suitable **security tools** and **prevention measures**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** & **CSS** – Structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** – Map interaction and logic  
- **PHP** – Backend logic and data processing  
- **OpenStreetMap** (via Leaflet.js) – Interactive map
